# **Building Transistor Circuits Part 2**

Project lead - Mr. Walmer



This project students worked together or independently to build transistor circuits.
Each group of students were given a kit with a bread board, capacitors, resistors, transistors, a battery pack, and LED.
Students tried a different project with circuits in the second week in this activity.

**STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.**  
Our STEM Club is an informal, noncompetitive group of students and sponsors dedicated to exploring STEM.

We plan to make sciency things and talk about STEM and learn about STEM careers.  
No competition, just fun!  

**Meet in Mr. Kokerâ€™s room (B20) on Mondays at 7:15 am to learn more!**

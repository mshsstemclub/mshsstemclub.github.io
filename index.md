**STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) Club**  
Our STEM Club is an informal, noncompetitive group of students and sponsors dedicated to exploring STEM. We do STEM hands on activities and learn about STEM careers. 

**Meet in Mr. Kokerâ€™s room (B20) on Mondays at 7:15 am to learn more!**

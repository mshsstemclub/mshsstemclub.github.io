**The Mahomet-Seymour High School STEM Club provides opportunities for students to participate and lead STEM projects each meeting.** 


## **STEM Projects**


# **Week 1 Project**
Oracle Sort Card game
Project leader - Mr. Walmer

**The Oracle Sort Card provides a hands on opportunity to learn about Sorting Algorithms**

Computers use algorithms to quickly solve problems.

**An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.**  
Computers follow a pre-determined set of instructions to place objects in the desired order.




# **Different Sorting Methods**

**Bogo Sort** - a method of shuffling until correct.                                                            

**[Bubble Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLLwm_WN68)** - a method of working with one item at a time and checking to see where it fits by checking it compared to every other item in the list.   

**[Insertion Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmDnM9gUxNc)** - a method of inserting one item at a time.  This is an easy way to sort.  It is one of the fastest ways to sort small lists.

**[Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSceec-wEyw)** - a method based on divided the larger group into smaller groups and sorting each smaller group before merging them into a larger group.                                                     
This method is slower for smaller groups and more ideal for larger groups.  

**[Quick Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDQd6_0TJIE)** - a method of starting with one pivot point item and placing items with certain values on either side of the pivot.  
This method is more ideal for larger groups that need sorted.                                                   

**Selection Sort** - a method based on selection.  This is an easy way to sort, but slow for large lists.                                                           


Using a card game created by Dr. Lynford Goddard the STEM club members tried their own method to sort 8 cards.  
STEM Club members used different methods to sort.                         
Comparing and contrasting the different sorting methods STEM club members used could show which sorting method would be best for different applications in the real world.

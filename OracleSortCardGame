**The Mahomet-Seymour High School STEM Club provides opportunities for students to participate and lead STEM projects each meeting.** 


## **STEM Projects**


# **Week 1 Project**
Oracle Sort Card game
Project leader - Mr. Walmer

**The Oracle Sort Card provides a hands on opportunity to learn about Sorting Algorithms**

Computers use algorithms to quickly solve problems

# **Different Sorting Methods**

**Bogo Sort** -      

**Bubble Sort** -    

**Insertion Sort** - a method of inserting one item at a time.  This is an easy way to sort.  It is one of the fastest ways to sort small lists.

**Merge Sort** -                                                    

**Quick Sort** -                                                         

**Selection Sort** - a method based on selection.  This is an easy way to sort, but slow for large lists.                                                           


Using a card game created by Dr. Lynford Goddard the STEM club members tried their own method to sort 8 cards.  
STEM Club members used different methods to sort.                         
Comparing and contrasting the different sorting methods STEM club members used could show which sorting method would be best for different applications in the real world.

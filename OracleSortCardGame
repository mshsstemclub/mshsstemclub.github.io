**The Mahomet-Seymour High School STEM Club provides opportunities for students to participate and lead STEM projects each meeting.** 


## **STEM Projects**


# **Week 1 Project**
Oracle Sort Card game
Project leader - Mr. Walmer

**The Oracle Sort Card provides a hands on opportunity to learn about Sorting Algorithms**

Computers use algorithms to quickly solve problems

# **Different Sorting Methods**

Bogo Sort                                               
Bubble Sort                                            
Insertion Sort                                               
Merge Sort                                                   
Quick Sort                                                        
Selection Sort                                                            


Using a card game created by Dr. Lynford Goddard the STEM club members tried their own method to sort 8 cards.  
STEM Club members used different methods to sort.                         
Comparing and contrasting the different sorting methods STEM club members used could show which sorting method would be best for different applications in the real world.
